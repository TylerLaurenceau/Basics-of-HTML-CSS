*Super excited to start my journey into front end development.*


This is a very basic webpage made with HTML and CSS.

Here is what i've learned in each language through this project:

# HTML
* The (`a`) tag.
* The (`img`) tag.
* The difference between spans and divs.
* How to use href (hypertext reference).
* When to use classes and when to use ids.
* How to make lists (both organized and unorganized).


#CSS
* Coloring text.
* Coloring backgrounds.
* How to properly call ids(`#`).
* How to manipulate `padding`,`margin`,and `border`.
* How to change text size.


#Bonus
* Basic terminal commands such as locating, deleting, moving, and creating files.
* Using git to remember and restore lost files as well as using git to post my creations to github.
